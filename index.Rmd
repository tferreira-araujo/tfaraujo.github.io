Hello, everyone! 

I'm Thais Ferreira-Ara√∫jo and this is my personal academic website. Here you can find out more about me and my work as a scientist/researcher. Besides work, I'm also part of the [500 Women Scientist](https://500womenscientists.org/), Natal-Brazil pod. From time to time, I participate in online classes through [Skype a Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/) to talk about my work, science, and fish.

Here is my full [CV](files/CV_Thais_english.pdf).
